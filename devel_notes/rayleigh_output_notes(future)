Notes from CIG Telecon Regarding outputs:

1.  Work on the prefactors in front of the magnetic terms so that lorentz force magnetic energies are correct regardless of dimensionalization chosen.

2.  Have a nusselt number output.

3.  Enable outputs of vector fields in cylindrical geometry (theta_hat -> z_hat)

4.  Code up the work terms, like u dot jxb

//////////////////////////////////////////////
Longer-term changes
1.  Equatorial plane output
2.  Run summary files in ASCII containing basic information, like KE and ME
3.  Power spectra output (?  This wasn't really a suggestion - but might be useful)
4.  Interpolation onto a cylindrical grid...
