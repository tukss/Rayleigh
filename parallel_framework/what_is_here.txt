This directory contains the portions of the PseudoCode that govern the 
parallel framework of the code.  Here you will find:

Communication.f90 -  routines related to the MPI communication
Load_Balancing.f90 - establishes the load_balancing for each 
configuration
Transposes.f90  - routines for moving between between different 
configurations via transposes

configuration convention:
1a - z/r in processor (physical) ; delta  m/l or kx/ky
1b - z/r in processor (spectral) ; delta  m/l or kx/ky

2a - y/theta in processor (physical) delta  r/m or z/ky
2b - y/theta in processor (spectral)  delta r/m or z/kx

3a - m/kx in processor (physical) delta  r/theta or z/x
3b - m/kx in processor (spectral)  delta r/theta or z/x
