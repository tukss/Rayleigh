# What is Rayleigh? #

Rayleigh is a 3-D convection code designed for the study of planetary and stellar dynamos.  Rayleigh evolves the incompressible and anelastic MHD equations in spherical geometry using pseudo-spectral approach, with spherical harmonics in the horizontal and Chebyshev polynomials in the vertical.  Rayleigh has been developed with NSF support through the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics ([CIG](https://geodynamics.org/cig/news/newsletters/may-2016/)).

# What Makes Rayleigh Unique? #
Rayleigh is a pseudo-spectral code optimized for petascale performance.  It has demonstrated highly efficient strong scaling on  131,000 cores of the Mira Blue Gene/Q supercomputer for problems with approximately 2048^3 grid point (2048 spherical harmonics).  Performance numbers from Mira are shown below.

# When Will Rayleigh Be Released?#
Rayleigh is sleighted for release on June 19, 2016.  In the meantime, please pardon the mess.  The code and (and presently incomplete) documentation are in a state of flux.  See the Wiki and the documentation directory (in the source) for tips.  Some videos corresponding to the images below can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/feathern24).
